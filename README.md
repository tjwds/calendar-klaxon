# ðŸ“£ðŸ“… Calendar Klaxon

**Keep focus in frame.** A macOS application that draws a silly, moving border around your screen when you have a meeting coming up.

![A screenshot of a macOS desktop, with a vibrant border drawn by the Calendar Klaxon application.  A menubar dropdown is open, showing that an event titled "Some thing you shouldn't be late to" is alerting.  Preferences are visible, like toggling animation and toggling calendars.](./screenshot.png)

## Some questions you might have

- **Why is this macOS-only?** Because I built this for me, which means I built it for macOS! I don't have immediate plans to make a Linux or Windows version.
- **Why do you need permission to see the events on all my calendars?** This app keeps all calendar data on your local device, but it needs full access to your calendar to be able to check for upcoming events. You can use network monitoring software like Little Snitch to see that this app makes no network requests.
- **Can I exclude certain calendars?** Yes! Go to Preferences â†’ Enabled calendars.
- **Can I turn off the animated border?** Yes! I need the animation at the corner of my vision in order to have the constant reminder that I have a meeting coming up, but you can turn this off under Preferences.
- **Isn't this more annoying?** It doesn't annoy _me_, but I can see how you might find it annoying. For me, it's more of a trade-off: I am filled with delight by this little purple border, and it popping up throughout the day is way less annoying to me than being late to a meeting.
- **I have a question, but it's not listed here.** Great! Raise a GitHub issue, or email me at calendarklaxon@joewoods.dev.
